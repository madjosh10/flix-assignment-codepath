## Overview
For this unit's app assignment, you'll build the first part of a movie browsing app--similar to Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes--that lets a user view and scroll through a list of movies. To do this, you'll learn how to get data from the internet (via an API) and display it in a scrollable list in your app; two core concepts you'll use in virtually every app you'll ever build! When finished, your app will look similar to the app pictured above.

### Plan of attack 
1. Get a list of movies--including info about each movie, i.e. title, description and movie poster image.
2. Display each movie in a way that scrolls up and down to see all movies.

### Bonus User Stories
- [X] User can view the app on various sizes and orientations
- [X] Run your app on a real device

### Fixing constraints
- []

### Another View
- [] Passing data to another view controller
- [] Showing users data
- [] Go back to previous view
